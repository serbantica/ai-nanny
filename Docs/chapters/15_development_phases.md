# 15 Development Phases

## 15.1 Planning
In the planning phase, objectives are set, resources are allocated, and a timeline is established. It's crucial to identify the scope and scale of development to ensure alignment with project goals.

## 15.2 Design
The design phase involves outlining the system architecture and design patterns. This stage requires collaboration between stakeholders to finalize the structures that will guide the development.

## 15.3 Implementation
In the implementation phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers will utilize the design documents to create functional software components and conduct initial testing of individual units.

## 15.4 Testing
Testing is essential to validate the functionalities of the software. This phase includes system testing, user acceptance testing, and any iterations necessary to refine the software.

## 15.5 Deployment
Deployment is the process of making the software available for use. This may include rolling out the software in stages or using continuous deployment practices.

## 15.6 Maintenance
The maintenance phase ensures that the software continues to function correctly after being deployed. Regular updates, bug fixes, and optimizations are part of this phase to enhance performance and user experience.
