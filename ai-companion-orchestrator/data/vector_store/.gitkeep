# Vector Store Directory

This directory contains ChromaDB vector store data.

**Note:** This directory is gitignored. Vector store data is generated from documents and should not be committed to version control.

## Regenerate Vector Store

If you need to recreate the vector store:

1. Ensure you have documents in `../documents/`
2. Run the ingestion script:
   ```bash
   python ingest_documents.py
   ```
