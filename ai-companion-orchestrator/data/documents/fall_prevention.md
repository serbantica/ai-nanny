## Introduction
Falls are the leading cause of injury among seniors. This comprehensive guide provides AI companions with strategies to prevent falls and ensure resident safety.

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Factors
- **Age over 75 years**
- **History of previous falls**
- **Use of mobility aids** (walkers, canes)
- **Vision or hearing impairment**
- **Medications causing dizziness or drowsiness**
- **Cognitive impairment or dementia**
- **Balance or gait problems**
- **Muscle weakness**

### Environmental Hazards
- Loose rugs or carpets
- Poor lighting
- Cluttered walkways
- Slippery floors
- Uneven surfaces
- Missing handrails
- High or low bed height

## Daily Safety Checks

### Morning Safety Routine
1. **Check Lighting**: Ensure adequate lighting in all areas
2. **Clear Pathways**: Remove obstacles from walking routes
3. **Footwear Check**: Verify resident is wearing proper non-slip shoes
4. **Mobility Aid Inspection**: Check walker/cane for stability
5. **Floor Condition**: Look for spills or wet areas

### Throughout the Day

## Environmental Modifications

### Bathroom Safety
- **Install grab bars** near toilet and in shower
- **Use non-slip mats** in tub and shower
- **Raised toilet seat** for easier transfers
- **Shower chair or bench** for seated bathing
- **Adequate lighting** including nightlight
- **Easy-reach shelving** to avoid stretching

### Bedroom Safety
- **Bed at proper height** (feet touch floor when sitting)
- **Nightlight** for visibility
- **Clutter-free** floor space
- **Sturdy bedside table** for support
- **Phone within reach**
- **Clear path to bathroom**

### Living Areas
- **Secure rugs** with non-slip backing or tape
- **Remove cords** from walkways
- **Adequate lighting** throughout
- **Furniture arrangement** allows clear pathways
- **Non-slip floor treatments** on smooth surfaces
- **Handrails** on both sides of stairs

## Mobility and Strength

### Daily Exercise Recommendations
- **Balance exercises**: Tai Chi, standing on one foot
- **Strength training**: Chair exercises, resistance bands
- **Flexibility**: Gentle stretching, yoga
- **Walking**: Regular daily walks with assistance if needed

### Exercise Safety Guidelines
- Always have support nearby
- Start slowly and progress gradually
- Stay hydrated
- Wear proper footwear
- Stop if feeling dizzy or unsteady

## Footwear Guidelines

### Recommended Footwear
- **Low-heeled shoes** (less than 1 inch)
- **Non-slip soles** with good traction
- **Proper fit** - not too loose or tight
- **Closed-toe design** for protection
- **Velcro or elastic** for easy wear
- **Supportive arch** and heel

### Footwear to Avoid
- Slippers without backs
- High heels
- Shoes with smooth soles
- Loose-fitting shoes or sandals
- Shoes with laces (trip hazard)

## Medication Management and Falls

### Medications That Increase Fall Risk
- **Blood pressure medications** (can cause dizziness)
- **Sleep aids** (cause drowsiness and impaired balance)
- **Pain medications** (especially opioids)
- **Antidepressants** (may affect balance)
- **Muscle relaxants** (cause weakness and dizziness)
- **Diabetes medications** (low blood sugar affects balance)

### Precautions
- Monitor blood pressure regularly
- Take medications with food when recommended
- Rise slowly from sitting or lying positions
- Wait 30 seconds before walking after standing
- Report any dizziness to healthcare provider

## Vision and Hearing

### Vision Safety
- **Regular eye exams** (at least annually)
- **Update prescriptions** promptly
- **Clean glasses** daily
- **Adequate lighting** for all activities
- **Remove glare** from windows and screens
- **Mark steps** with contrasting colors

### Hearing Safety
- Regular hearing assessments
- Keep hearing aids maintained and charged
- Face resident when speaking
- Reduce background noise
- Visual cues for important alerts

## Transfer Techniques

### Sit-to-Stand Transfers
1. **Position**: Scoot to edge of chair
2. **Feet**: Place feet shoulder-width apart
3. **Lean Forward**: Nose over toes
4. **Push**: Use armrests to push up
5. **Stabilize**: Stand fully before moving

### Bed Transfers
1. **Roll to Side**: Use bed rails for support
2. **Swing Legs**: Move legs off bed edge
3. **Push Up**: Use arms to push to sitting
4. **Pause**: Sit for 30 seconds
5. **Stand**: Using proper sit-to-stand technique

## AI Companion Fall Detection

### Detection Capabilities
- Motion pattern analysis
- Sudden movement detection
- Audio monitoring (thud, cry for help)

### Response Protocol
1. **Immediate Assessment**: Check camera or audio feed
2. **Voice Contact**: "Are you okay? Do you need help?"
3. **Alert Emergency Services**: If no response or injury suspected
4. **Notify Staff**: Contact nurse station immediately
5. **Family Notification**: Alert designated family members
6. **Document**: Record incident details

## Emergency Response

### If a Fall Occurs
1. **DO NOT move the person** unless in immediate danger
2. **Call for help** immediately (911 if injured)
3. **Provide comfort** and reassurance
4. **Check for injuries**: bleeding, deformity, pain
5. **Monitor consciousness** and breathing
6. **Keep warm** with blanket if needed
7. **Document everything**: time, location, circumstances
